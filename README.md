# Aminomap
Explore the whole-protein-sequences by entire short segments, create a new amino-map.


Aminomap is a project for searching a sequence-space of protein.


The significance of this project is 
1. Possible all aminoacid-patterns searched in whole protein sequence in human and other model animals.
2. Occurence of famous- or rare-aminoacid-patterns in short-fragments of 1 - 6 aa were searched on whole protein sequence.
3. non-utilized sequence-space of aminoacids-pattern was proved.


Next purpose is 
1. construct a algorithm to conjugate the short-fragments to make a long sequence.
2. make a new artificial-protien in a non-utilized sequence space.
3. New protein-score creates by short-fragments occurence.
